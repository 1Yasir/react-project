# React Application
We created this React application to develop different React projects, allowing us to increase our knowledge of React and practice using React props and hooks.

# Password Generator
PasswordGenerator Component
 # What I Did
# Initialized State Variables:

length: Stores the password length.
password: Stores the generated password.
includeNumbers: Checks if numbers should be included in the password.
includeSpecialChars: Checks if special characters should be included in the password.
Created generateRandomPassword Function:

Generates a random password based on the specified length and whether to include numbers and special characters.
Used useEffect Hook:

Automatically generates a new password whenever length, includeNumbers, or includeSpecialChars change.
Rendered the Component:

Displayed the generated password in a read-only input field.
Added a range slider to adjust the password length.
Added checkboxes to include numbers and special characters in the password.
Why I Did It

Effect Hook:
